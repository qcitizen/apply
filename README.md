# Exercise

Write a function that compresses an alphanumeric string by collapsing consecutive values. The rules of the compression algorithm are defined by the test cases below.


## Test cases

Each item below has an input value and the expected output from the function.

1. `aaabccccdd` â†’ `a3bc4d2`
2. `aaaaaffffffffffc` â†’ `a5f10c`
3. `abcd` â†’ `abcd` (note: not `a1b1c1d1`)
4. `ccceee12eccceee` â†’ `c3e4c3e3` (numbers removed)
5. `effeac01cb65c` â†’ `ef2eac2bc`
