# Quantified Citizen String Compression Code Assessment

Must have Elixir installed on your local machine.

[Elixir installation instructions](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#by-operating-system)

Run the tests:

```bash
$ mix test
```

## Description

All code is in the `qc.ex` module. Together with Elixir's function clauses, I used `Enum.reduce/3` to compress input strings.

Test cases are in `qc_test.exs`. All other files in this pull request were generated when creating a new mix project.
